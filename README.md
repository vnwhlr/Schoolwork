Most of the moderately interesting code I've written for school. None of this is presented with a great deal of context or instructions, mostly because I've forgotten them, considering all of this was written at least a year ago. This is presented exclusively for your perusal, just so you don't think I was lying on my resume. I have tried to remove references to the specific courses I wrote this code for, as to avoid facilitating plagiarism. I have also tried to remove secret keys and URLs of servers set up by my professors, as to avoid $12,000 charges to my AWS account and DOS attacks (even though some of them deserve it). Some files contain barely coherent, yet lively discussions with myself in the comments, giving you a hint as to the kind of headspace I was in when I wrote this code. This is not at all representative of code I would write for production, as I aspire to put far more insidious code into production. I would strongly recommend against attempting to run any of it, and I am not liable if your machine explodes in the miraculous event you manage to successfully do so (even though, that would be kind of neat).
